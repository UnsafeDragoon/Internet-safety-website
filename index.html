                <p>Internet safety is the act of making smart decisions online to ensure personal security and wellbeing. This takes many different forms from avoiding a hateful conversation to reporting dangerous activity you witnessed on social media. The root of all good decision making comes from personal judgment based on facts and logic.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="contentp-2">
                    <p>As we move further into the modern age, technology is becoming more important and included in daily life. The extent of how much one prioritizes internet safety directly affects not only them, but those around them as well. With wrong decision making, people can jeopardize the ones closest to them and leave them vulnerable to breaches in privacy. For example, if spyware were to be installed on a computer used by multiple people; not only would the person at fault have their information stolen, but all of the accounts tied to the computer would also be compromised.</p>
